/* DOCUMENT logger
  Usage:
    if(logger(error)) logger, error, "<message>"
    if(logger(warn)) logger, warn, "<message>"
    if(logger(info)) logger, info, "<message>"
    if(logger(debug)) logger, debug, "<message>"
    if(logger(trace)) logger, trace, "<message>"

  Logs the given message to the log file at the given log level, if the given
  log level is enabled.

  Calls to the logger command should ALWAYS be protected by if statements as
  shown above. If a log level is disabled, the subcommand will resolve to the
  integer 0 instead of a function; that in turn will generate an error if the
  log level is disabled and the call is not protected by an if statement.

  The benefit of protecting with an if statement is that, when disabled, the
  cost of the logger call is reduced to a single boolean check. If your message
  string has any overhead, that overhead is thus negated.

  The logger command is guaranteed to be available in ALPS. However, it may not
  be automatically available in some non-ALPS scenarios, such as distributed
  job calls. In such code, if you do not wish to explicitly require the logger
  library, you can instead protect logger calls as follows:

    if(logger && logger(debug)) logger, debug, "<message>"

  -- Log File Location --
  The location of the log file is determined as follows.
    - If running in ALPS, then "alpsrc" should be available and should contain
      a "log_dir" setting. If present, this is used.
    - Otherwise, if an environment variable ALPS_LOG_DIR is available, it is
      used.
    - Otherwise, /tmp/alps.log/ is used.

  -- Log File Name --
  The log file will be given the name YYMMDD.HHMMSS.PID or
  YYMMDD.HHMMSS.PID.USERNAME. This encodes the start-up time (as a date and
  time), the process ID, and (if available) the current user's login name. More
  specifically:
    - If running under YTK, the date/time will be when Tcl started and the
      process ID will be that of YTK.
    - If not running under YTK, the date/time will be the time of the first log
      message.
    - If not running under YTK and get_pid is available, then Yorick's PID is
      used. Otherwise, the PID will be set to 0.
    - The username will only be included if it's available. It will always be
      available under ALPS/YTK. Otherwise, it may or may not be available.

  -- Log Levels --
  Five log levels are defined. They should be used as follows.

    error - Something really bad happened, something that most likely
      interrupted what the user was doing with an error.

    warn - Something somewhat bad happened. A deprecated function was used, a
      function was used in a poor way, an "almost error" occured, etc. This is
      something undesired and/or unexpected, but not exactly wrong.

    info - Interesting events in normal usage. Startup and shutdown info.
      Invocation of important commands (such as batch commands). Loading of
      files.

    debug - Detailed information about the flow through the system.

    trace - Extremely detailed inforamtion that one would not normally want
      even during debugging. This might include dumping of lots of data or the
      logging of state during each iteration of a large loop.

  The level at which logging occurs is set by the logger_level command. By
  default, ALPS logs at the "debug" level and higher. This corresponds to this
  invocation:

    logger_level, "debug"

  It is expected that ALPS will usually log at the "debug" level. If very high
  performance is critical, it may be helpful to set the debug level to "info"
  but this is generally discouraged. The "trace" debug level should only be
  turned on when there is a specific need for it, as it may lead to excessively
  large log files.
