/* Supporting unsigned integers as distinct interpreted data types
 * in yorick would cause a large jump in the number of numeric types,
 * without (in my judgment) producing a significant gain in functionality.
 * Unsigned arithmetic in C actually has many unavoidable misfeatures,
 * which I do not want yorick to inherit.  For example, binary operators
 * implicitly promote signed integers to unsigned, which is a terrible
 * problem.  For example, in graphics code, the width of a window is
 * often unsigned, which makes it impossible to write a correct algebraic
 * expression for centering something in the window without an explicit
 * cast operation.  People have a tendency to use the unsigned type when
 * what they mean to do is to assert that a quantity is non-negative.
 * This is undoubtedly why width is unsigned.  But of course, what unsigned
 * really means is that the arithmetic operations are slightly different
 * than what you expect -- in particular, subtracting a larger number
 * has a very surprising result, and division is simply different (which
 * is why the centering formula doesn't work).
 *
 * This file contains implementations of all the operations which
 * differ between signed and unsigned arithmetic.  These are:
 *   u_gt(x,y)   x>y
 *   u_lt(x,y)   x<y
 *   u_ge(x,y)   x>=y
 *   u_le(x,y)   x<=y
 *   u_eq(x,y)   x==y
 *   u_ne(x,y)   x!=y
 *   u_shr(x,n)  x>>n
 *   u_div(n,d)  n/d
 *   u_mod(n,d)  n%d
 * Although the x==y and x!=y comparisons are the same for signed
 * and unsigned operands when x and y have the same type, they
 * differ when the types of the two operands differ, because of the
 * implicit cast operation.  The standalone cast operation is:
 *   u_cast(x, s)   x as an unsigned s (or unsigned x as an s)
 * For all other operations (x+y, x*y, x<<n, x!=y, etc.), the bit
 * pattern produced by the signed operation is identical to the bit
 * pattern produced by the unsigned operation.
 *
 * Note that char is unsigned by default in yorick, so these functions
 * do nothing different than the operators.  For completeness, a cast
 * operation is provided to interpret char as a signed quantity:
 *   s_char(x)  return signed char x as short
 *
 * To print unsigned integers:
 * 1. print in %x format, which is intrinsically unsigned
 * 2. if sizeof(structof(x))<sizeof(long), print u_cast(x,long)
 * 3. print highest decimal digit separately from the rest, e.g.-
 *    xhi = u_div(x,1000000000, xlo);  // if sizeof(long)==4
 *    xhi = swrite(format="%ld",xhi);
 *    list = where(xhi=="0");
 *    if (numberof(list)) xhi(list) = "";
 *    write,format="... %s%ld ...", ..., xhi,xlo, ...;
