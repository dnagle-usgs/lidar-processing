  These are utilities for unpacking the CIR and CAM tar files and then
  putting the images into subdirectories that Wayne can use for a website.

	fixup.pl  - rename CIR images by removing the -NNN- portion of the name.
	makecir.pl- unzip each tar file into a directory in the form:
              YYYYMMDD/photos/HHMM
