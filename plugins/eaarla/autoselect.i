  dataset. The dir parameter should be the path to the mission day directory.

  The function attempts to find an appropriate ops_conf.i file by following
  these steps:

    1. Is there a file named ops_conf.i in dir? If so, it is returned.
    2. Do any files in dir match *ops_conf*.i? If so, those files are sorted
       by name and the last is returned.
    3. The same as 1, except looking in dir's parent directory.
    4. The same as 2, except looking in dir's parent directory.

  If no file can be found, then the nil string is returned (string(0)).

  If options=1, then an array of all possibilities that meet the criteria above
  is returned instead. If no possiblities are found, then [string(0)] is
  returned.
