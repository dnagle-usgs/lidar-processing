This directory contains the RCF Yorick plugin.

IMPORTANT: This plugin is DEPRECATED. Do NOT install it.

This plugin is deprecated in favor of the C-ALPS plugin, found in
yorick-extend/calps. Please install that plugin instead. If you have already
installed the rcf plugin, then please uninstall it as it conflicts with the
calps plugin.
